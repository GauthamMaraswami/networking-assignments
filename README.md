1.A media acess control is the physical address(unique) of network interfaces on the physical network segment.
  packets sent from ethernet is directed to a network using mac address in the physical network layer.
  A media access control address (MAC address), also called physical address, is a unique identifier assigned to network interfaces
  for communications on the physical network.a network interface controller is used to connect computer to network it has the mac 
  address which is unique to the network interface.

2.Digital data is converted to digital signals by line encoding.Common types of line encoding are unipolar,polar,bipolar,multilevl(manchester)
  Unipolar encoding is a line code. A positive voltage represents a binary 1, and zero volts indicates a binary 0. It is the simplest line code, 
  directly encoding the bitstream, and is analogous to on-off keying in modulation.
  polar encoding line code is a binary code in which ones are represented by one significant condition, usually a positive voltage, 
  while zeros are represented by some other significant condition, usually a negative voltage, with no other neutral or rest condition. 
  bipolar encoding is a type of line code, where two nonzero values are used, so that the three values are +, âˆ’, and zero. 
  multilevel is a line code in which the encoding of each data bit is either low then high, or high then low, of equal time. 
  It therefore has no DC component, and is self-clocking

3.Transmission medium is the pathway through which data is transferred from one place to another
  it is broadly classified into guided and unguided medium.unguided medium are radio transmission and microwave transmission.guided ones are coaxial,optical fibre and twisted pair
  when speed is not required in case of guided twisted pair cables are used it is cost effective.if speed is considered ofcs are used but it is not cost effictive.co axial cable gives
  reasonable speed and cost.coaxial transmission is further divided into broadband and baseband.baseband digital signal is transmitted as it is where as in broadband
  they are converted to broadband and then transmitted.If communication is with remote areas radio or microwave transmission is preferred.

4.a.OSI is protocol independent                           TCP/IP is based on standard protocols
  b.flows vertically                                      flows horizontally
  c.has separate presentation                             does not have separate presentation layer and
   layer and session layer
  d.provides both connection oriented                     provides only connectionless services
    and connection less service
  e.Protocols are hidden and can be easily                replacing protocol not easy
    replaced as technology changes
  f.has seven layers                                      has 4 layers

5.modern high speed LAN has low error rates so no need of data integrity provided by osi
  LAN applications need very fast setup with each other but the connection mode
  transfer in OSI requires an agreement between 3 parties, users and the service provider,
  hence it is slow. few programs can use or wrongly use the 7 layers of
  the model: the session and presentation layers are hardly used and on contrary the data link
  and network layers are often split into several sub-layers, since they are pretty complex. 
  OSI model is not adapted at all to telecommunication applications on computer. Some
  choices are in disagreement with the way computers and software communicate

6.Today all organizations use more than one computers, to provide communication between computers networking is necessary.A network must be able to meet certain criterialike
  Performance:-it is measured in times of trnsit time and response time. for a good network both of these should be low.sharing of devices is possible.data traffic can be managed
  Reliability:-the frequency at which network failure take place. More the failures are, less is the network's reliability.
  Security:-protection of data from the unauthorised user or access.
  To provide best possible network model to provide easy,fast and cost reliable communications between the nodes we need networking.

7.digital data to analog signal This method is used to send computer information over transmission channels that require analog signals, 
  like a fiber optic networks, computer modems, cellular phone networks, and satellite systems. In each of this systems, an electromagnetic
  carrier wave is used to carry the information over great distances and connect digital information users at remote locations.
  The digital data is used to modulate one or more of the parameters of the carrier wave
  there are three types:-Amplitude Shift Keying (ASK),Frequency Shift Keying (FSK), and Phase Shift Keying (PSK).
  in analog to digital transmission:-A digital signal can be transmitted over a dedicated connection between two or more users.
  In order to transmit analog data, it must first be converted into a digital form. This process is called sampling, or encoding. Sampling involves two steps:
  Take measurements at regular sampling intervals , and Convert the value of the measurement into binary code.
  in digital to digital conversion   digital data which is a collection of zeroes and ones, where the value at any one time is called a bit. 
  In order for two digital users (like computers) to communicate there must be an agreement on the format used. There are several different ways in which a 
  binary number by be formatted. This is called pulse code modulation or PCM. The most straightforward PCM format is designated as NRZ-L, for non return to zero level.
  In this format, the level directly represents the binary value: low level = 0, high level = 1.
  analog to analog there are thee types of modulation amplitude modulation, frequency modulation and phase modulation
  depending on factors like type of data ,distance to be transported ,encoding and decoding capacity loss of message a proper modulation technique is selected.
